    <h1>57 Books That Informed The Way I Approach Software Development</h1>
    <p>Published on <time>September 20, 2021</time> by

    <p>I talked about how valuable books are for learning software development
      in my previous article,
      <a href="/2021-09-10-learn-software-development-by-reading-books/">Learn
      Software Development By Reading Books</a>. This gave me the idea that it
      might be a fun challenge to recall some key and foundational books I’ve
      read, and roughly the order I read them.</p>
    <p>There have been plenty of tech books I wouldn’t consider formative, and
      they won’t be included. On the flip side, there have been some books that
      were influential to the way I approach software development that aren’t
      tech books, so I’ll mention them, too.</p>
    <p>Ok, buckle up for a ride down memory lane!</p>
    <aside>
      <p>If you’re inspired to read any of these books, please check your local
        libraries and used book stores before purchasing new copies. Buy them
        directly from the author if that’s an option.</p>

      ZZT-OOP Programming Language</h2>
    <p class="subhead">1991, Tim Sweeny</p>
    <p>The first entry is an exception to the rule, as it’s an in-program help
      document and not a book. Stick with me, though!</p>
    <p>Although I played around with my dad’s 286 a fair amount in the early
      90’s, when he got a new Pentium machine with Windows in 1995, I inherited
      the old clunker and began my programming journey.</p>
    <p>A game I was already familiar with in 1995, ZZT, came with a level editor
      including its own programming language: ZZT-OOP. With unfettered access to
      the computer, I took it on myself as a young’un to master this
      language.</p>
    <p>The help document is organized much like a programming book—and you can
      print it! It was my first foray into reading about software development,
      and deserves to be included.</p>

      Microsoft® MS-DOS® Operating System version 5.0 User’s Guide and
      Reference</h2>
    <p class="subhead">1991, Microsoft</p>
    <p>My dad insisted on keeping this book in proximity to the 286 when he gave
      me the computer. So, it was around, I was feeling empowered by having
      learned how to use a programming language, so I found myself reading this
      tome. It definitely helped me generalize what I had learned about
      computing.</p>

      TI-83 Guidebook</h2>
    <p class="subhead">1996, Texas Instruments</p>
    <p>I usually had spare time during math class in secondary school because I
      completed assignments quickly. When we were assigned graphing calculators,
      I used some of this time to read through the user guide, which included a
      chapter on how to create custom programs.</p>
    <p>Of course, the custom programs I created were games. I recall making a
      suite of games of chance and transferring them to the other calculators
      by connecting them with wires.</p>

      HTML 4 for the World Wide Web Visual Quickstart Guide (Fourth
      Edition)</h2>
    <p class="subhead">1999, Elizabeth Castro</p>
    <p>My girlfriend in 1999 was taking info-tech class at the same time as I
      had phys-ed. Obviously, I skipped class to hang out with her in the
      computer lab. Although I never took info-tech, this book was an assigned
      reading in that class, and I grabbed a copy anyway.</p>
    <p>A cool thing about this book was that it introduced me to Cascading
      Stylesheets, which I would become a strong advocate for during the
      “Browser Wars.” But, man, was CSS different back in the Internet Explorer
      4 days. It’s telling that this is the fourth edition of a book whose first
      edition came out three years earlier.</p>

      SAMS Teach Yourself Visual Basic 6 in 24 Hours</h2>
    <p class="subhead">1999, Greg Perry with Sanjaya Hettihewa</p>
    <p>I recall using the included IDE to build a tile-based RPG with my own
      sprite art and doing my own sound engineering. I was actually focused on
      being an artist and musician at this time in my life; programming was a
      part-time job more than anything.</p>
    <p>This would be the beginning and end of my interest in “Teach Yourself
      <i>X</i> in <i>Y</i> Hours” books, not to mention proprietary programming
      languages.</p>

      Java 2: The Complete Reference (Third Edition)</h2>
    <p class="subhead">1999, Patrick Naughton and Herbert Schildt</p>
    <p>At this point, I realized I was more interested in web development than
      making desktop apps. I wanted to add interactivity to my websites, so the
      obvious choice was to learn how to make Java Applets! Frustratingly, the
      limitations of how the applets could interact with the content of the web
      pages left me wanting something better.</p>

      Pure JavaScript: A Code-Intensive Premium Reference</h2>
    <p class="subhead">1999, R. Allen Wyke, Jason D. Gilliam, and Charlton
      Ting</p>
    <p>My first book on JavaScript was almost as thick as it was wide, thanks
      in large part to the amount of content about <em>server-side
      JavaScript</em>! That’s right, server-side JavaScript ten years before
      Node.js. There was a big chunk about Netscape’s APIs, and another about
      Microsoft’s. I never did play with any of that server-side stuff, but I
      read and reread the core JavaScript syntax until I knew it inside and
      out.</p>

      Beginning Perl</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2000, Simon Cozens with Peter Wainwright</p>
    <p>I picked up Perl as it became clear that I needed interactivity on the
      server side. With this book’s <i>Introduction to CGI</i>, I got just that.
      This is when I started to dig into Apache httpd, and get to know web
      servers more deeply.</p>
    <p>This was also my first deep dive into regular expressions. There’s
      something about the way regex are presented in this book that resulted in
      my ability to gain fluency that has lasted me my whole career.
      <a href="https://www.perl.org/books/beginning-perl/">Beginning Perl is
      available online for free</a> now, so take a look at the <a
      href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblob.perl.org%2Fbooks%2Fbeginning-perl%2F3145_Chap05.pdf"

      Web Database Applications with PHP &amp; MySQL: Building Effective
      Database-Driven Web Sites</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2002, Hugh E. Williams and David Lane</p>
    <p>Although the Perl book got me working with databases, this book is where
      I really solidified the fundamentals. This was around the time that Web
      2.0 was emerging: the “read-write Web.” This marked a big shift in the
      kinds of software development projects I was taking on because of the
      relative ease of shipping an app to a shared LAMP server.</p>

      Designing with Web Standards</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2003, Jeffrey Zeldman</p>
    <p>The orange one! This book got me really fired up about web standards and
      thinking about the apps I was making as products that are meant to hit a
      certain bar for quality.</p>

        loading="lazy" />
      The Zen of CSS Design: Visual Enlightenment for the Web</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2005, Dave Shea and Molly E. Holzschlag</p>
    <p>This book was based on Dave’s popular website,
      <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>. I was lucky
      enough to work with Dave for a while at Bench Accounting, and I can
      confirm that he has a very structured way of thinking about design, which
      I appreciate immensely.</p>
    <p>At the time I read this book, even though CSS had decent support in IE,
      Firefox, and Opera (I don’t know about Safari—not many Mac users to worry
      about back then,) most popular websites were still sliced images in HTML
      tables. The whole CSS Zen Garden <em>thing</em> was a big step forward for
      getting the industry to adopt the technology.</p>

    <p>I had been following Dan’s blog for some years when he <a
      href="http://vault.simplebits.com/notebook/2005/06/28/bpwd/">announced
      this book</a>. I was already engaged with his approach to web design, so
      it was great to see his thoughts published in this format.</p>
    <p>I had the pleasure of chatting with Dan at Web Directions North 2007, and
      by that time I had already started implementing some of his ideas in my
      projects, to great success.</p>

      Using Microformats</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2006, Brian Suda</p>
    <p>I remember watching Microformats emerge and being very pumped about the
      idea. When a downloadable PDF “book” about it became available, I just had
      to show my support. Anything you’d ever want to know about Microformats is
      on the <a href="https://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page/">Microformats

      Jim Thatcher, Shawn Lawton Henry, Bruce Lawson, Andrew Kirkpatrick,
      Christian Heilmann, Michael R. Burks, Bob Regan, and Mark Urban</p>
    <p>I had been following Bruce Lawson when he <a
      href="https://brucelawson.co.uk/2006/web-accessibility-web-standards-and-regulatory-compliance/"
      >announced</a> this book. Accessibility was a major consideration in the
      work I was doing, and this book was crucial for my development at the
      time.</p>
    <p>I was lucky to have an accessibility mindset going into the smartphone
      age, when new assistive technologies would be developing at a breakneck
      pace to keep up with the development of mobile tech.</p>

      Don’t Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability (Second
      Edition)</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2005, Steve Krug</p>
    <p>Many of the authors whose blogs I was following had mentioned this book
      at some point. It took me a while, and a second edition release, before I
      gave it a go. It seems like it’d be a risk to publish a book where the
      content is just a bunch of common sense, but I’ll tell ya, it helps to
      have it printed on paper when you need to convince someone that something
      is common sense.</p>

      Bulletproof Ajax</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2007, Jeremy Keith</p>
    <p>The infamous “Hijax” book. This book was about adding functionality to
      websites with JavaScript, but it clearly described a strategy for graceful
      degradation, showing unequivocally that there’s no reason to exclude less
      capable user agents just because you want a dynamic website.</p>
    <p>Pretty soon smartphones would be invented and a whole slew of new, less
      capable devices would hit the web. This was going to be a very important
      idea!</p>

      The Art &amp; Science of CSS</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2007, Cameron Adams, Jina Bolton, David Johnson, Steve
      Smith, and Jonathan Snook</p>
    <p>I won this book in a <a
      href="https://www.themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2007/05/09/"
      >contest held by Cameron on his blog</a>. At that point in time, I was
      living the web standards life, and this book added some great tools to my
      arsenal.</p>
    <p>The book had a whole chapter on rounded corners; CSS did not have the
      <code>border-radius</code> property at the time. The modern look in those
      days was to put rounded corners on everything. Of course, now that it’s
      one line of CSS to add rounded corners, the modern look is square corners.

      RESTful Web Services: Web Services for the Real World</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2007, Leonard Richardson and Sam Ruby</p>
    <p>Everybody was talking about REST, and nobody seemed to know what they
      were talking about. Folks were getting excited about doing mashups between
      sites, and it seemed like new applications were meant to come with public
      APIs.</p>
    <p>This book really helped me make sense of the hype at the time. Later it
      would become a guidepost for many later design decisions as more of my
      work became, in essence, API development.</p>

      JavaScript: The Good Parts</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2008, Douglas Crockford</p>
    <p>This book is notorious. To get an idea for the tone of this book, check
      out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7664379246A246CB"
      >presentations Douglas Crockford gave at Yahoo on JavaScript</a>. Many
      books on JavaScript tiptoe around the language’s weirdness. This book
      takes that weirdness head on…with railroad diagrams.</p>
    <p>One great thing about reading this book was that it gave me some backup
      when I needed to argue against using tricky code to get something
      done.</p>
    <p>The best thing, though, was being introduced to JSLint. Static code
      analysis and code quality tools would soon become an important part of my
      development process.</p>

      High Performance Web Sites: Essential Knowledge for Frontend

    <p class="subhead">2007, Steve Souders</p>

      Even Faster Web Sites: Performance Best Practices for Web

    <p>This is the nitty-gritty, current (at the time) tech for making fast

      Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2002, David Allen</p>
    <p>Being self-employed requires a lot of discipline when managing resources,
      especially time. This book is presented as a list of techniques for time
      management that you can either take or leave.</p>
    <p>An important takeaway for me was that brains are not for information
      storage and retrieval—use tools for that. Write stuff down in a place you
      check regularly. Now I use Google Keep with the widget on my Android
      phone’s home screen, so I see my notes every time I unlock my phone.</p>
    <p>Another important one was, if it takes less than two minutes (or your
      preferred time box), just do it immediately. That one is so broadly
      applicable that it’s touched many parts of my life outside of work.</p>

    <p>I came at this book from an angle that may be somewhat unusual. I was
      working on replacing the client application for an existing app, so the
      code was all new, and the database would remain the same.</p>
    <p>My key takeaways were: write code that will be easy to refactor; don’t
      write code that you will want to refactor anytime soon; and, write
      testable code, because you can’t safely refactor if you don’t know what
      you’re breaking (and you’ll be breaking things.)</p>

    <p>I don’t know how well it aged; there was a blog not too long ago asking,
      “Is it time we stopped recommending Clean Code?” I think the book probably
      comes across differently to new and experienced developers. Strong advice
      in a book can’t really be clarified by the reader, so unless the reader
      already has strong counterarguments, it might come through as
      doctrine.</p>
    <p>It might be intended as doctrine, but if taken as just another way to

      definitely offers a picture of the professionalism that software
      developers can hold themselves to.</p>

      Developing Backbone.js Applications: Building Better JavaScript
      Applications</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2013, Addy Osmani</p>
    <p>Frontend frameworks had recently become a thing. Web users were coming to
      expect single page applications. A little jQuery on top of a server-side
      rendered application was the old way of doing things, so new projects had
      to choose a framework to build on—not a decision to be taken lightly.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Chrome, JavaScript engines in all browsers were becoming more
      powerful every release, and new frameworks work were coming out regularly,
      trying to harness this new power.</p>
    <p>There were some players who were around for a while already, like Dojo
      Toolkit. The front page of Hacker News at the time was frequented by
      Backbone, Angular, and murmurs of React. It felt like the right move to
      dig into these new approaches and pick one to build on. Backbone won me at
      the time with its dedication to simplicity.</p>

    <p class="subhead">2013, Michael Fogus</p>
    <p>Backbone had one dependency: Underscore.js. There had been attempts to
      make a flexible utility library for JavaScript, separate from a DOM
      library (Ajax library?) like jQuery. Prototype.js was a popular one, and
      it left a bad taste in many developers’ mouths because of its choice to
      extend base types instead of simply defining pure functions that act on
      them.</p>
    <p>Underscore, and books like this, were an important part of helping
      JavaScript developers to learn the functional programming vernacular. I
      saw a shift to simpler frontend solutions once the devs started applying
      more functional programming concepts.</p>

      The Kubernetes Book</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2017, Nigel Poulton</p>
    <p>At the time, this was the must-read, “How to speak devops,” book. Sick of
      all the problems with the older ways of deploying microservices, it seemed
      like everyone was extremely eager to immerse themselves in the problems of
      the newer ways. On that note, everything that I said about Docker Deep
      Dive applies here as well.</p>

      Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2016, Cal Newport</p>
    <p>My strategy for getting focus time at work is to wake up early and get
      into the office a few hours before everyone else. Lucky for me, most devs
      don’t get to the office until 10:30 or so. But that raised the question,
      how do those devs get focus time.</p>
    <p>A handful of us at my company had been recommended to read this book by
      the head of engineering. By spreading these ideas around, I think the idea
      that people wanted to be uninterrupted really made it into the culture,
      and there was some real improvement on reducing distractions.</p>

      HTTP/2 in Action</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2019, Barry Pollard</p>
    <p>It was strange watching Chrome take over the browser market and then push
      its own protocols, SPDY and QUIC. Sometimes I would come to work and look
      in the Network tab in my dev tools and be confused by seeing new
      protocols.</p>
    <p>Eventually HTTP/2 became a proper standard, and folks outside of Google
      were playing with how to optimize their sites using it. It was
      messy—server push was getting people excited, but ended up being less
      useful than originally thought. A lot of optimization came from merely
      using the protocol (which meant figuring out how to get your server to
      speak it.)</p>
    <p>I chose to read this book on it because it came after things had settled
      down a bit and a lot of kinks had been worked out. That was a good call; I
      had read books on tech that was too fresh before, and that’s really not
      the time to be putting things into print.</p>

      Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2019, Ryan Singer</p>
    <p>The company I was at when this came out was looking for a better way to
      triage projects and get the most out of their small software engineering
      team. The head of engineering at the time figured we should give this
      approach a try. The technical leadership team and I gave this a read and
      hashed out how we could progressively adopt the parts of the approach that
      would work for us.</p>

      TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols (Second Edition)</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2011, Kevin R. Fall and W. Richard Stevens</p>
    <p>One day at work, I gave a presentation about the protocol stack to the
      developers on my team. It was short, and I felt confident in what I said,
      but afterward, I started reflecting on just how deep my understanding of
      the protocols was. The problem was, I didn’t know how deep because I had
      picked up most of my knowledge over the years on the job.</p>
    <p>This book was a great opportunity for me to fact-check my understandings
      of the protocols and reinforce my knowledge of the history that lead to
      the refinement of the protocols into what we contend with today.</p>

      Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed
      Systems (Third Edition)</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2020, Ross Anderson</p>
    <p>Ross already had plenty of cred with me via his <a

      >appearances on YouTube</a>. Somehow I caught wind of this new edition and
      immediately ordered it and dug in.</p>
    <p>In the same way that my approach to application development changed when
      I started making decisions based on the holistic understanding of software
      development as a business, the comprehensive approach to this book,
      including its reflections on past editions, have prompted me to think
      about security engineering in a more holistic way, too. I also am saying
      “capable, motivated opponent” more regularly now.</p>

      ZZT</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2014, Anna Anthropy</p>
    <p>ZZT meant a lot to me, for reasons made obvious by this post. It was
      wonderful to read this book about the impact it had on so many others. I
      am among the many people in my generation that got their start in
      programming using the ZZT level editor, and this book helped me understand
      the similarities between my path and the paths of others from that
      community.</p>

      The Psychology of Computer Programming: Silver Anniversary Edition</h2>
    <p class="subhead">1971, 1998, Gerald M. Weinberg</p>
    <p>I don’t recall when I first stumbled on the <a
      href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/"
      >Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming</a>, but I had been passing it
      out for years before I thought to myself, “I ought to actually read the
      book that that’s based on.”</p>
    <p>This book was a real trip! Written in 1971, with notes at the end of each
      chapter added in 1998, and read by me in 2021, it was fascinating to hear
      how little has changed in software development in fifty years. The
      experience got me really pumped to dig more into the history of software
      development and to better understand not only how we got to where we are,
      but what the dead ends along the way were as folks experimented with
      approaches.</p>

      Becoming a Technical Leader: An Organic Problem-Solving Approach</h2>
    <p class="subhead">1986, Gerald M. Weinberg</p>
    <p>I started reading this book in 2019, but didn’t finish until 2021. I was
      purchasing another Weinberg book and spotted this one in the
      recommendations and thought, “This is very relevant to me <em>right
      now</em>,” so I grabbed it. I got a couple chapters in, then another book
      became <em>even more</em> relevant. When I finally picked this one back
      up, it prompted me to create this very website with my first article,
      <a href="/2021-08-23-word-processor-that-works-like-pen-and-paper/">Word
      Processor That Works Like Pen And Paper</a>.</p>
    <p>I expect to be writing more articles prompted by Weinberg books as I
      focus more on technical leadership and read more from the Quality Software
      Management series.</p>

    <p class="subhead">2006, Jukka K. Korpela</p>
    <p>Another book from a series of purchases prompted by conversations about
      technologies that I had learned on the job. I had been working with
      Unicode for a long, long time, and had a pretty solid understanding of it.
      But, when I was in the position of explaining it in depth verbally, I
      realized I didn’t have many the specifics memorized. Having read this and
      done experiments and further research, I expect to be able to explain
      Unicode concepts more thoroughly and correctly than before.</p>
