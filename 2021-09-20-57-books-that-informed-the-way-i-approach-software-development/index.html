    <h1>57 Books That Informed The Way I Approach Software Development</h1>
    <p>Published on <time>September 20, 2021</time> by
      <a href="https://davidvandusen.com/">David VanDusen</a>.</p>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>I talked about how valuable books are for learning software development
      in my previous article,
      <a href="/2021-09-10-learn-software-development-by-reading-books/">Learn
      Software Development By Reading Books</a>. This gave me the idea that it
      might be a fun challenge to recall some key and foundational books I’ve
      read, and roughly the order I read them.</p>
    <p>There have been plenty of tech books I read over the years that I
      wouldn’t consider formative, so I won’t mention them. On the flip side,
      there have been some books that were influential to the way I approach
      software development that aren’t tech books, so they’re in the list.</p>
    <p>Ok, buckle up for a ride down memory lane!</p>
    <aside>
      <p>If you’re inspired to read any of these books, check your local
        libraries, used book stores, and friends’ bookshelves before purchasing
        new copies. Otherwise, buy directly from authors if that’s an
        option.</p>

      ZZT-OOP Programming Language</h2>
    <p class="subhead">1991, Tim Sweeny</p>
    <p>The first entry is an exception to the rule since it’s an in-program help
      document and not a book. Stick with me, though!</p>
    <p>I played around with my dad’s 286 a fair amount in the early 90’s, and
      when he got a new Pentium machine with Windows in 1995, I inherited the
      old clunker and began my programming journey.</p>
    <p>A game I was already familiar with in 1995, ZZT, came with a level editor
      with its own programming language: ZZT-OOP. With exclusive access to the
      computer and the kind of free time that only kids have, I took it on
      myself to master this language.</p>
    <p>The help document is organized much like a programming book—and you can
      print it! This was my first foray into reading about software
      development.</p>

      Microsoft® MS-DOS® Operating System version 5.0 User’s Guide and
      Reference</h2>
    <p class="subhead">1991, Microsoft</p>
    <p>My dad insisted on keeping this book in proximity to the 286 when he gave
      me the computer. So, it was around, and I was feeling empowered by having
      learned how to use a programming language, so I found myself reading this
      tome. It definitely helped me generalize what I had learned about
      computing.</p>

    <h2 id="ti-83-guidebook">
      <img

        loading="lazy" />
      TI-83 Guidebook</h2>
    <p class="subhead">1996, Texas Instruments</p>
    <p>I usually had spare time during math class in secondary school because I
      completed assignments quickly. When we were assigned graphing calculators,
      I used some of this time to read through the user guide, which included a
      chapter on how to create custom programs.</p>
    <p>Of course, the custom programs I created were games. I recall making a
      suite of games of chance and transferring them to the other calculators
      by connecting them with wires.</p>

      HTML 4 for the World Wide Web Visual Quickstart Guide (Fourth
      Edition)</h2>
    <p class="subhead">1999, Elizabeth Castro</p>
    <p>My girlfriend in 1999 was taking info-tech class at the same time as I
      had phys-ed. Being a nerd, I skipped class to hang out with her in the
      computer lab. Although I never took info-tech, this book was an assigned
      reading in that class, and I grabbed a copy anyway.</p>
    <p>A memorable thing about this book was that it introduced me to Cascading
      Stylesheets. My early, positive exposure to CSS would become an important
      guidepost in my subsequent technical development. But, man, was CSS
      different back in the Internet Explorer 4 days. It’s telling that this is
      the fourth edition of a book whose first edition came out only three years
      earlier.</p>

      SAMS Teach Yourself Visual Basic 6 in 24 Hours</h2>
    <p class="subhead">1999, Greg Perry with Sanjaya Hettihewa</p>
    <p>I recall using the IDE included on this book’s companion CD-ROM to build
      a tile-based RPG with my own sprite art and sound design. I was focused on
      being an artist and musician at this point; programming was just a
      part-time job.</p>

        loading="lazy" />
      Java 2: The Complete Reference (Third Edition)</h2>
    <p class="subhead">1999, Patrick Naughton and Herbert Schildt</p>
    <p>I realized I was more interested in web development than desktop apps. I
      wanted to add interactivity to my websites, and the obvious way to do that
      was with Java Applets. Frustratingly, the limitations of how applets
      could interact with the content of the web pages left me wanting something
      more integrated.</p>

    <h2 id="pure-javascript">

        src="pure-javascript.jpg"

      Pure JavaScript: A Code-Intensive Premium Reference</h2>
    <p class="subhead">1999, R. Allen Wyke, Jason D. Gilliam, and Charlton
      Ting</p>
    <p>What I really wanted was JavaScript. My first book on JavaScript was
      almost as thick as it was wide, thanks in large part to the amount of
      content about <em>server-side JavaScript</em>! That’s right, server-side
      JavaScript ten years before Node.js. There was a big chunk about
      Netscape’s APIs, and another about Microsoft’s. I never did play with any
      of that server-side stuff, but I reread the core JavaScript syntax until I
      knew it by heart.</p>

        height="207"
        width="160"
        loading="lazy" />
      Beginning Perl</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2000, Simon Cozens with Peter Wainwright</p>
    <p>I picked up Perl to fulfil the need to do server-side form processing and
      persistence. With this book’s <i>Introduction to CGI</i>, I got just that.
      This is when I started to dig into Apache httpd, and get to know web
      servers more deeply.</p>
    <p>This was also my first deep dive into regular expressions. There’s
      something about the way regex are presented in this book that resulted in
      my ability to gain fluency that has lasted me my whole career.
      <a href="https://www.perl.org/books/beginning-perl/">Beginning Perl is
      available online for free</a>, so take a look at the <a
      href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblob.perl.org%2Fbooks%2Fbeginning-perl%2F3145_Chap05.pdf"
      ><i>Regular Expressions</i> chapter</a> yourself, if you’re interested.
      I’d bet it still holds up!</p>

      Web Database Applications with PHP &amp; MySQL: Building Effective
      Database-Driven Web Sites</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2002, Hugh E. Williams and David Lane</p>
    <p>Although the Perl book got me working with databases, this book is what
      solidified the fundamentals. This was around the time that the Web 2.0
      trend was emerging. Websites were expected to have interactive forms, now.
      Coupled with the relative ease of shipping an app to a shared LAMP server,
      this marked a major shift in the kinds of projects I was doing.</p>

      Designing with Web Standards</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2003, Jeffrey Zeldman</p>
    <p>As an artist, I always thought about what I was building from the
      perspective of craft, and creating polished works. This book got me fired
      up the level of craftsmanship I could achieve.</p>

      The Zen of CSS Design: Visual Enlightenment for the Web</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2005, Dave Shea and Molly E. Holzschlag</p>
    <p>This book was based on Dave’s popular website,
      <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>, which many
      folks who were doing web development back in the early 2000’s think fondly
      on. I was even lucky enough to work with Dave for a while at Bench
      Accounting, and I can confirm that he has a very structured way of
      thinking about design, which I appreciate immensely.</p>
    <p>At the time I read this book, even though CSS had decent support in IE,
      Firefox, and Opera (I don’t know about Safari—not many Mac users to worry
      about back then,) most popular websites were still sliced images in HTML
      tables. The whole CSS Zen Garden <em>thing</em> was a big step forward for
      getting the industry to adopt the technology.</p>

      this book</a>. I was already engaged with his approach to web design, so
      it was great to see his thoughts published in this format.</p>
    <p>I had the pleasure of chatting with Dan at Web Directions North 2007, by
      which time I had already started implementing some of his ideas in my
      projects, to great success.</p>

    <p>Many authors in my RSS feed had mentioned this book at some point. It
      took me a while, and a second edition release, before I gave it a go. It
      seems like it’d be a risk to publish a book where the content is just a
      bunch of common sense, but lemme tell ya, it helps to have it printed on
      paper when you need to convince someone that something is common
      sense.</p>

      Using Microformats</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2006, Brian Suda</p>
    <p>I was pumped about Microformats as it was emerging. Something felt so
      right about having a broader alignment across the web about how common
      kinds of content would be described. When a downloadable PDF “book” about
      it became available, I had to show my support. That said, anything you’d
      ever want to know about Microformats is on the

      Bulletproof Ajax</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2007, Jeremy Keith</p>
    <p>Core tenets of the web standards movement in the 2000’s were progressive
      enhancement and graceful degradation. It might be time to revive those
      terms for the current generation.</p>
    <p>This book was about adding functionality to websites with JavaScript in a
      way that did not exclude less capable user agents. Notably, the “Hijax”
      technique for submitting forms with Ajax but falling back to HTML form
      submission shows how simple it can be to not exclude users. With more
      folks using ad-blockers and disabling JavaScript, these approaches could
      bring a lot of value today.</p>
    <p>Soon after the publication of this book, smartphones would become
      commonplace and a whole slew of less capable devices would hit the web.
      This was going to be a very important idea!</p>

      >contest held by Cameron on his blog</a>. It finally paid to have studied
      fine arts all that time.</p>
    <p>The book had a whole chapter on rounded corners; CSS did not have the
      <code>border-radius</code> property yet. The modern look in those days was
      to put rounded corners on everything. Of course, now that it’s one line of
      CSS to add rounded corners, the modern look is square corners.

      about. Folks were getting excited about doing mashups between sites, and
      it seemed like new applications were expected to have public APIs.</p>
    <p>This book really helped me make sense of the hype at the time. Later it
      would become a guidepost for many later design decisions as more of my
      work became, in essence, API development.</p>

      >presentations Douglas Crockford gave at Yahoo on JavaScript</a>. Many
      books on JavaScript tiptoe around the language’s weirdness. This book
      takes that weirdness head on…with railroad diagrams.</p>
    <p>One great thing about reading this book was that it gave me some backup
      when I needed to argue against collaborators using tricky/hacky code to
      get something done.</p>
    <p>The best thing, though, was being introduced to JSLint. Static analysis
      and code quality tools would become an important part of my development
      process.</p>

    <p>Being self-employed requires a lot of discipline managing resources,

      for time management.</p>
    <p>An important takeaway for me was that brains are not for information
      storage and retrieval—use tools for that. Write stuff down in a place you
      check regularly. Now I use Google Keep with the widget on my Android
      phone’s home screen, so I see my notes every time I unlock my phone.</p>
    <p>Another important one was, if a task will take less than two minutes (or
      whatever your preferred time box is,) do it immediately. That one is so
      broadly applicable that it’s touched many parts of my life outside of
      work.</p>

    <p>I was being referred for contracts building Rails apps. It became
      apparent Rails was designed to support a certain scrappy, agile approach

    <p class="subhead">1994, Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John

    <p>It was time to read some classics. I was working on enterprise Java
      software at the time, so I encountered a lot of these patterns in the
      frameworks I was using. That’s probably the best way to learn design
      patterns, I imagine.</p>
    <p>Whenever I recommend this book, I tell people to buy it, and then read
      the two pages inside the front cover a few times. Those pages just list
      the patterns with a short description of each. Once you know what they’re
      called and what they’re for, you have everything you need to know. The
      rest of the book is a reference for when you’ve identified there’s a
      pattern in use or one you might want to implement.</p>

    <p>I came at this book from a somewhat unusual angle. I was working on
      replacing the client application for an existing app, so the app code was
      all new, and only the database would remain the same.</p>
    <p>My key takeaways were: write code that will be easy to refactor; don’t
      write code that you will want to refactor anytime soon; and, write
      testable code, because you can’t safely refactor if you don’t know what
      you’re breaking (and you’ll be breaking things.)</p>

      enjoyable.</p>
    <p>I don’t know how well it aged; there was a blog not too long ago asking,
      “Is it time we stopped recommending Clean Code?” I think the book probably
      comes across differently to new and experienced developers. It’s difficult
      for a reader to get clarification or contest strong opinions in a book, so
      unless they already have strong counterarguments, it might come through as
      doctrine.</p>
    <p>It might be intended as doctrine, but if taken as just another way to
      think about software development, I see it as having practical use. It
      definitely offers a picture of the professionalism that software
      developers can hold themselves to.</p>

      at the outset of a project.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Chrome, JavaScript engines in all browsers were becoming more

      Toolkit. The front page of Hacker News at the time was frequented by
      Backbone, Angular, and murmurs of React. It felt like the right move to
      dig into these new approaches and pick one to build on. Backbone won me at
      the time with its dedication to simplicity.</p>

      Functional JavaScript: Introducing Functional Programming with
      Underscore.js</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2013, Michael Fogus</p>
    <p>Backbone had one dependency: Underscore.js. There had been attempts to
      make a flexible utility library for JavaScript, separate from a DOM
      library (Ajax library?) like jQuery. Prototype.js was a popular one, and
      it left a bad taste in many developers’ mouths because of its choice to
      extend base types instead of simply defining pure functions.</p>
    <p>Underscore.js and books like this one, were an important part of helping
      JavaScript developers learn the functional programming vernacular. I saw a
      shift to simpler frontend solutions once the devs started applying more
      functional programming concepts.</p>

    <p>I found myself spending more of my work hours mentoring as the company I
      was at started taking on co-op students from the University of Waterloo.
      So, I started reading lots of introductory books on JavaScript in order to
      learn new ways of explaining JavaScript concepts. This is one of the few
      to make this list because of my fond recollections of just how
      well-written it is.</p>

      described in this book. Reading this book is an excellent example of how
      books can create common ground between professionals. After reading it, we
      had a huge amount of shared understanding of data visualization that we
      could use to discuss feature design.</p>

    <p class="subhead">2015, Gayle Laakmann McDowell</p>
    <p>I ended up becoming a software development teacher for some years, and a
      big part of teaching folks about software development is teaching them how
      to get a job. This book explains (and perpetuates) the misguided technical
      interview process that many companies use. I read it with clenched teeth,
      and came out the other side with improved advice for my students about how
      to slog through our industry’s insistence on keeping this archaic

    <p>I wonder how many of the students I recommended this book to actually
      read it. It tries to explain approaches to advancing your software
      development career in the form of design patterns. The problem is, folks
      who are new to software development probably haven’t learned to apply
      design pattern in their work yet, so I wonder how well this strategy works
      when applied to their careers.</p>

    <p class="subhead">2010, Kevlin Henney</p>
    <p>I acknowledge that my career in software development is not typical, and
      so I had hoped that reading about others’ experiences might help me to be
      a better mentor to people getting into the field. I don’t remember many
      specifics of the stories in this book, but it was interesting to hear how
      my experiences, although atypical, had many parallels to people who took a
      more traditional route.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t until I tried recommending this book to others that the lack of
      diversity of its authors was pointed out to me. I would hope that a book
      like this published nowadays would be more representative.</p>

    <p class="subhead">2018, Michael Schwartz and Maciuj Machulak</p>
    <p>The conversation around web application security has changed massively
      over the years. It used to be (worryingly) “Which hashing function do you
      use before storing passwords?” Luckily, the conversation is shifting
      toward federated identity, SSO, and MFA, and away from home-baked IAM.</p>
    <p>I think my takeaway from this book was the exposure to a consistent voice
      on the variety of topics involved in IAM, which are normally discussed
      piecemeal in documentation and other resources.</p>

    <p>Having had my computers’ resources eaten by VMs for the years leading
      upto containers becoming mainstream, I was super pumped to learn this
      stuff as well as I could. Since the containerization landscape was and
      still is shifting, the best a book can do for you is to lay a solid
      foundation, but it’s worth it—that’s not what the docs and examples are
      for.</p>

      everyone was eager to subject themselves to the problems of the newer
      ways. On that note, everything that I said about Docker Deep Dive applies

      Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2016, Cal Newport</p>
    <p>My strategy for getting focus time at work is to wake up early and get
      into the office a few hours before everyone else. Lucky for me, most devs
      don’t get to the office until 10:30 or so. But that raised the question,
      how do those devs get focus time?</p>
    <p>A handful of folks at my company had been recommended to read this book
      by the head of engineering. By spreading these ideas around, I think the
      idea that people wanted to be uninterrupted really made it into the
      culture, and there was some progress on reducing distractions.</p>

      HTTP/2 in Action</h2>
    <p class="subhead">2019, Barry Pollard</p>
    <p>It was strange watching Chrome take over the browser market and then push
      its own protocols, SPDY and QUIC. I remember coming into work and opening
      up the Network tab in my dev tools to be met with strange new kinds of
      traffic.</p>
    <p>Eventually HTTP/2 became a proper standard, and folks outside of Google
      were playing with how to optimize their sites using it. It was
      messy—server push was what people were excited about, but it ended up
      being less useful than originally thought. A lot of optimization came from
      merely using the protocol (which meant figuring out how to get your server
      to speak it.)</p>
    <p>I chose to read this book on it because it came after things had settled
      down a bit and a lot of kinks had been worked out. That was a good call; I
      had read books on tech that was too fresh before, and that’s really not
      the time to be putting things into print.</p>

      approach a try. The technical leadership team and I gave this a read and
      hashed out how we could progressively adopt the parts of the approach that
      would work for us. I won’t comment on how successful we were.</p>

    <p>One day at work, I gave a presentation about the protocol stack to the
      developers on my team. It was short, and I felt confident in what I said,
      but afterward, I started reflecting on just how deep my understanding of
      the protocols was. The problem was, I didn’t know how deep it went because
      I had picked up most of my knowledge over the years on the job.</p>
    <p>This book was a great opportunity for me to fact-check my understandings

      Unicode for a long time and had what I thought was a solid understanding
      of it. But, when I was in the position of explaining it in depth verbally,
      I realized I didn’t have many the specifics down pat. Having read this and
      done experiments and further research, I expect to be able to explain
      Unicode concepts more thoroughly and correctly than before.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>Well, that was a trip! After writing all that, I feel like I have a
      better understanding of the role that books play in software development
      education. It was surprising to think about how many technologies I
      learned on the job instead of from books. For many of those technologies,
      I feel like it would be a blast to read a book or two to see what I’m
      missing. 🤓</p>
