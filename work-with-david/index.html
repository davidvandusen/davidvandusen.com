    <h1>Work with David</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>This guide describes what it’s like to work with David, his style, and
      preferences. It includes some advice for how to get the most out of David
      and what you can expect from him.</p>
    <h2>The basics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Call him David or Dave depending on your preference.</li>
      <li>When groups have more than one David, call him “dv” (dee-vee) which is
        also his preferred Slack handle.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What David values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning and sharing knowledge brings David great joy. If you have a
        random fact or are enjoying the book you’re reading, tell him about
        it!</li>
      <li>David is a team player, but he’s not competitive. If he’s on your team
        you won’t be sorry, because he’s pretty capable, but he’s playing to
        build relationships, not for pride.</li>
      <li>
        <p>David has favourite quotes that he shares because they are dear to
          him and they convey his way of thinking well. These include:</p>
        <details>
          <summary>Hofstadter’s Law</summary>
          <p>“Hofstadter’s Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even
            when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.”</p>
          <p><small>Douglas R. Hofstadter<br />
            Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid (1979)</small></p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>We have not succeeded in answering all our
            problems…</summary>
          <p>“We have not succeeded in answering all our problems—indeed we
            sometimes feel we have not completely answered any of them. The
            answers we have found have only served to raise a whole set of new
            questions. In some ways we feel that we are as confused as ever,
            but we think we are confused on a higher level, and about more
            important things.”</p>
          <p><small>Earl C. Kelley<br />

    <h2>How David works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>First thing in the morning is when David does his best work and
        learning. He prefers to do difficult tasks that require the most
        concentration before having too much social interaction.</li>
      <li>In general, David enjoys conversations that are fast-paced. He’s also
        very comfortable with long silences. If the cadence of his conversation
        doesn’t work well for you, just let him know. He’s happy to slow things
        down or to fill the silences.</li>
      <li>David would rather hear your opinion than give his own. If you want to
        hear David’s opinion, know that if you ask a general question, he might
        explore a lot of ground with his answer. A focused question will receive
        a more focused answer.</li>
      <li>Interrupt him if you get the gist of what he’s saying. He likes
        it.</li>
      <li>It’s hard to convince David that a matter is black and white. It’s
        best to show that you’ve looked at it from multiple perspectives and
        considered trade-offs before trying to persuade him, otherwise he’ll try
        to discover an alternate point of view with you.</li>
      <li>David writes things down. Look to him if you want something
        thoughtfully documented.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How David is growing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The more topics David explores, the more aware he becomes of the
        limits of his knowledge. If you know something that David doesn’t, help
        him synthesize the new knowledge into his own if you can.</li>
      <li>David knows that he has habits and biases to unlearn. He also knows
        that others’ perceptions of his actions will be different from what he
        intended. The best way to help him is to give him immediate, direct
        feedback if you notice him engaging in a habit he’s trying to
        break. Try to frame your feedback from your own perspective.</li>
      <li>David reads books. In order to integrate new knowledge from books into
        his existing knowledge, he’ll often bring up ideas from the book he’s
        currently reading. When he does this, listen, and drill down to see if
        he deeply understands what he’s suggesting.</li>
