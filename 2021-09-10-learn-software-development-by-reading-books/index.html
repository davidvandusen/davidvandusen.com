    <h1>Learn Software Development By Reading Books</h1>

    <p>Software developers new to the field often reach out for guidance on how
      to reach the ‚Äúnext level‚Äù in their career. Beyond correcting the
      assumption that expertise in a field is stratified into discrete levels, I
      often extol the virtues of reading books over web resources. Why? Because
      that‚Äôs what works for me. But also, my explanation is usually met with
      a-ha‚Äôs, and produces action.</p>
    <p>The rationalization I give includes the following factors that contrast
      learning from books to learning from forums, blog posts, magazines,
      tutorials, and the like.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Books have more information, and that information is more structured.
        Authors make choices for how to organize the content of books, and they
        know that readers have been exposed to information earlier in the book
        and can leverage that in later explanations.</li>
      <li>Books from major publishers go through rigorous editing, including
        technical review by other experts.</li>
      <li>The contents of books have been typeset in a way that helps to
        communicate the information effectively. The fonts, figures, and
        typographic conventions have been carefully chosen and committed to
        fixed media to ensure that readers have the best chance of getting the
        most out of the text. Sadly, ebooks don‚Äôt share this advantage.</li>
      <li>Books that have been revised and released as later editions have
        proven themselves to be successful for many readers, and the revisions
        polish explanations, taking into account feedback received for earlier
        editions.</li>
      <li>While many books tutorialize similarly to online courses, they have
        more space to give tips and expose gotchas thanks to the medium.
        Footnotes, appendices, and callouts offer further detail when utilized,
        and later chapters often dive deep into advanced techniques for doing
        tasks described earlier on.</li>
      <li>Many books have published lists of errata, which I encourage readers
        to seek out. Seeing the kinds of errors that even technical editors miss
        is extremely valuable for understanding the nuances of the topic.</li>
      <li>Unsure whether a book will be a good investment? There‚Äôs a high
        likelihood that there will be online reviews of it. Learning to ignore
        the star ratings and read the content of the reviews is an important
        skill. With a little extra searching, you can find reviews by industry
        professionals on their personal blogs‚Äîprobably the best information
        available about the quality of a title.</li>
      <li>Sharing books is an effective way to create a significant amount of
        common technical ground between professionals.</li>
      <li>Books become references once they‚Äôve been read. Using books for
        reference has a tendency to reveal related, contextual information about
        the content being looked up.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Having said all that, I admit: there are some topics that are less ideal
      to learn from books, and some there just aren‚Äôt books about! I‚Äôve used
      numerous technologies during my career that were still in development.
      Their APIs were in flux, and there the audiences were too small for books
      to be economically viable.</p>
    <p>Another gotcha is the time it takes to read a book versus the pressure of
      implementing a technology on the job. It pays to be in the habit of
      thinking ahead a few weeks about what unfamiliar technologies will be used
      in upcoming projects.</p>
    <p>I also recommend reading books on familiar subjects. Advanced books on
      known topics can be put to use immediately, and that helps lock in the
      knowledge.</p>
    <p>One consequence of my belief in the utility of books is that I read a lot
      of books aimed at beginners in order to know what the best, most
      up-to-date titles to recommend are. An interesting benefit of that is that
      I get exposed to new ways of teaching concepts which is invaluable when
      mentoring devs.</p>
    <p>I don‚Äôt recall ever thinking that a book I had read was a waste of time.
      Even when the text didn‚Äôt flow, or there were typos, or I disagreed with
      the author about an opinion they expressed, I always came away a better
      dev. And, even if I don‚Äôt have the capacity to read every day, always
      having a next tech book to read keeps me motivated to become a more
      knowledgeable <span class="nowrap">professional. üìö</span></p>
