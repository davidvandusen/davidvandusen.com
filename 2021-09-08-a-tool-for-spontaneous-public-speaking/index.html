    <h1>A Tool For Spontaneous Public Speaking</h1>

    <p>Fairly frequently, when one colleague or student asks for the explanation
      of a concept, pattern, or decision, some number of others will express
      interest in hearing the explanation as well. Often this evolves from a
      whiteboarding session to a more formal presentation. Remote participants
      express interest, too. At that point, it’s often valuable to record the
      call so that it can be transcribed and archived for posterity.</p>
    <p>Over time as I’ve done more of these presentations, I developed tools and
      strategies for making these presentations as valuable as possible for all
      the attendees. Beyond public speaking skills and deep understanding of the
      subject, there are ways to help the audience focus on the presentation and
      connect the pieces of the explanation together.</p>
    <p>One such technique I’ve used is to open
      <a href="about:blank">about:blank</a> in a new tab in my browser, add
      <code>contenteditable</code> to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> in the
      debugger, zoom right in, and go full screen. Then, as I moved from one
      topic to another, I’d write a word or two to act as a heading.</p>
    <figure class="breakout">
      <img
        src="about-blank-slide.png"
        alt="White page with “Questions?” written, followed by a caret"
      />
      <figcaption>I usually make a joke about how “about:blank” is my favourite
        website as I’m typing it in.</figcaption>

    <p>One huge advantage of having this up on a screen share that’s being
      recorded is to make it easier to scrub through the video afterward to find
      the bit you’re looking for.</p>
    <p>For the live attendees, this helps provide a mental anchor for the new
      information that’s being presented. Changing the text regularly helps to
      establish a sense of how much content has been presented.</p>
    <p>It also gives note takers meaningful headings for their own notes. One
      other approach I’ve tried is to take notes for the group in a doc as I’m
      presenting, but this had major drawbacks. One is that my notes are written
      in my style with my understanding of the topic, and struggle to be
      generally accessible. Another is that the presentations would drag on
      because of the amount I’m typing. By keeping the amount I’m typing to a
      minimum—just headings as I change topics—the session flows more
      smoothly.</p>
    <p>After some success with this practice, I put up a tiny app that smooths
      out the rough edges of the look. It’s pre-zoomed-in, uses a sans-serif
      font, is dark mode, and has some other bells and whistles. Feel free to
      use it the next time you find yourself in an appropriate situation. It
      lives at <a href="https://slide.figureandsound.com/"
