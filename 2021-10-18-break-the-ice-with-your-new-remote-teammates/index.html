    <h1>Break the Ice with Your New Remote Teammates</h1>

    <p>Joining a new remote team feels very different from joining a team in an
      office. Video calls can feel like theyâ€™re strictly business, and thereâ€™s
      no coffee machine where you can strike up spontaneous, casual
      conversations as you wait for it to drip.</p>
    <p>So, we might need to learn new ways of opening up. Iâ€™ve seen teams have a
      lot of success with daily icebreaker questions. Taking five minutes to get
      silly or a bit personal every day can create tighter, better communicating
      teams. It also helps new members to integrate faster. You might be
      surprised by how much easier it is to talk business with someone when you
      know theyâ€™re just as into Scrabble as you are.</p>
    <p>One problem with icebreaker questions is that is can be difficult to keep
      track of which ones have been asked. It shouldnâ€™t take more than a second
      or two to pull one up thatâ€™s fresh.</p>
    <p>With that in mind, I made <a
      href="https://icebreaker.figureandsound.com/"
      >icebreaker.figureandsound.com</a>, which is a simple site for your team
      to use to get daily icebreaker questions. It has a number of features to
      make getting a fun question for your daily stand-up a breeze.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A new question awaits your team every day.</li>
      <li>The questions are shuffled differently for every team, so use it on
        more than one team at a time without repetition.</li>
      <li>Use the time machine to remind yourself of previous daysâ€™
        questions.</li>
      <li>Add your teamâ€™s work days so that you donâ€™t miss out on great
        questions over the weekends.</li>
      <li>Re-roll a question that isnâ€™t a good fit for the team.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are enough questions that a team shouldnâ€™t see a repeat for at
      least a year. Hopefully by that time youâ€™re all closer, more aware of the
      way each other thinks, and all that ice has long since
