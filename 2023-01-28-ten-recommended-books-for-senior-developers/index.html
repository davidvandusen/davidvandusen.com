    <p>I got a great message from a friend to ring in the new year.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>“Can you give me a list of 10 books you’d recommend? I’d like them to be
        work related—like, what should a senior software engineer read? They
        don’t necessarily have to be technical. I know you have a number of
        leadership-related books you’ve recommended to me in the past.”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I decided to create a page for this list so that it can be shared more
      broadly. Here it is, not in any particular order.</p>
    <h2>1. Becoming a Technical Leader</h2>
    <p>Published in 1986 by Gerald M. Weinberg, this is one perspective on
      technical leadership. It’s an interesting read because it has advice that
      can be applied immediately, and shows a good example of approaching
      leadership methodically.</p>
    <h2>2. Clean Agile</h2>
    <p>Publishes in 2020 by Robert C. Martin, this gives a grounded education of
      what “agile software development” truly is. I wish more folks in the
      industry would read this book.</p>
    <h2>3. The Goal</h2>
    <p>Published in 1984 by Eli Goldratt, this well-written piece of fiction
      about optimizing systems is often cited in software engineering circles.
      Its value to a senior developer is to show the difference between the kind
      of thinking that the folks on the factory floor (in our case, devs writing
      features) do in comparison to folks thinking about the interconnection
      between the subsystems. That’s the kind of thinking that’s needed from
      senior devs.</p>
    <h2>4. Site Reliability Engineering</h2>
    <p>Published in 2017, this compilation of many authors’ work can be
      eye-opening to an application developer. It talks about many parts of
      delivering software to users beyond just making the app work.</p>
    <h2>5. Measure What Matters</h2>
    <p>Published in 2017 by John Doerr, this is a book about OKRs. Senior
      developers are at the point in their career where they start taking on
      team-level responsibilities. Understanding the complexities of aligning
      team goals with company goals is crucial for when you’re accountable for
      larger parts of the company’s systems.</p>
    <h2>6. The Coaching Habit</h2>
    <p>Published in 2016 by Michael Bungay Stanier, this book gives to-the-point
      advice on how to be a coach. As a senior developer, more junior colleagues
      look to you for guidance. It’s important to learn the value of coaching to
      help the folks around you grow.</p>
    <h2>7. Security Engineering</h2>
    <p>Published in 2020 by Ross Anderson, this book touches briefly on as much
      about security engineering as it can. I find that developers in the
      earlier parts of their careers know that security is something they need
      to consider, but don’t have the breadth of experience to feel confident
      that they’re making the right choices for the sake of security. This book
      reveals more mature ways of thinking about security risks.</p>
    <h2>8. Designing Data-Intensive Applications</h2>
    <p>Published in 2017 by Martin Kleppmann, this book fills a really common
      gap I’ve seen in application developers who haven’t had the opportunity to
      scale the systems they’ve built. Enjoy getting into the details with this
      one!</p>
    <h2>9. “Effective” programming books</h2>
    <p>For some reason, the books about programming languages that empowered me
      the most to build software that I felt was of superior craftsmanship had
      “effective” in their titles. Effective Java and Effective JavaScript at
      the time gave me so many useful tools for making my code clearer, more
      maintainable, and more performant. Look for an “effective” book for your
      language.</p>
    <h2>10. Staff Engineer</h2>
    <p>Published in 2021 by Will Larson, the content of this book is definitely
      for folks who have been senior developers for many years already. That
      said, it does a great job of explaining how the software developer job
      changes as you continue to do it, and what skills you’ll need to develop
      for the next career phase.</p>
