    <p>Numerous times during my software development career, I knew the solution
      to a problem because I just so happened to read the API docs for some tool
      all the way to the end. The ends of API docs tends to be where
      troubleshooting for special cases lives. I’ve been continually surprised
      by the high proportion of those special cases that have come up in
      day-to-day work.</p>
    <p>As much as the end of the docs are a treasure trove of answers to
      frequently asked questions, there are also nuggets of wisdom tucked at the
      ends of module descriptions and method contracts. Being aware of known
      exceptions to the rules and other edge cases can be hugely beneficial to
      overall comprehension.</p>
    <p>When a new technology is being adopted where I’m working, I usually set
      aside a morning or two to read the docs in their entirety. At the time it
      can seem futile since, without hands-on experience, it can be difficult to
      connect with a lot of the content. However, there’s a huge benefit that
      can be taken advantage of often enough to guarantee the value of sticking
      through it.</p>
    <p>The main benefit I’ve gained from reading docs all the way through has
      been <strong>knowing where to find information when I eventually need
      it</strong>. Just knowing vaguely that, “Yes, I’m pretty sure the answer
      to that is in the docs,” has saved me days of grief, research, and
      refactoring over the years. 🔚</p>
