    <p>When I realized I could look at writing in a non-Latin script and make
      sense of it, it felt like a breakthrough. I could actually see it as text,
      not just texture on a page.</p>
    <p>A short while before my first trip to Japan, I built a little
      <a href="https://phonograph.figureandsound.com/">flash card app</a> to
      help me learn katakanaâ€”the script used in Japan for loan words, among
      other things. My hope was, even if I couldnâ€™t read most text (which would
      be written in other writing systems: hiragana and kanji,) I would be able
      to read some restaurant menus and signage. I didnâ€™t realize how much
      impact it would have on the way I see the world in general.</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m a monolingual English speaker. My grade school curriculum included
      French language classes, but the language didnâ€™t stick because there were
      few opportunities to practice it on the west coast of Canada. (The
      majority of French speakers in Canada are in Quebec, on the east coast,
      thousands of kilometers away.)</p>
    <p>I never had to engage with a writing system beyond the roman characters
      that can be input directly with the keys on a qwerty keyboard. I knew
      awkward ways to put accents on letters in the rare cases when I needed
      them.* But, even though I would see writing in other scripts thanks to the
      Chinese and Punjabi communities where I lived, I didnâ€™t have anything
      compelling me to learn how to interpret them.</p>

    <p>When I started to use katakana, I felt many of my assumptions about
      learning languages being challenged. Foremost was my belief that it would
      be difficult to learn a completely new writing system having lived in a
      Latin-centric world my whole life. Beyond that, I believed that the value
      of understanding a writing system would be minimal compared to learning to
      speak the languageâ€”a tradeoff due to the amount of investment
      required.</p>
    <p>Knowing now how easy it is when given the right constraints (for example,
      just learning the English names of letters in another alphabet,) and how
      valuable the insights it provides are, Iâ€™ve decided to learn more of the
      worldâ€™s writing systems. It feels like a great investment given the
      benefits Iâ€™ve gained from learning just one new script.</p>
    <p>One benefit that stands out is how much easier it has been listening to
      native Japanese speakers speaking English. The way my app works, you learn
      to recognize aurally and recite the characters in the writing system as
      well as recognize them visually and memorize their English names,
      accomplished using the <a href="https://wicg.github.io/speech-api/">Web
      Speech API</a>. I think this tuned my ear to the sounds used in the
      language, which also made learning about the culture behind the writing
      system more accessible. This led to an improvement in my ability to put
      myself in the shoes of people who have roots in a different culture from
      my own.</p>
    <p>As a software developer, I now have a better understanding of how users
      switch between input methods for different writing systems, and I am
      able to ensure that the interfaces I create are supportive to that use
      case.</p>
    <p>If youâ€™re interested in trying your hand at learning another alphabet,
      have a look through the supported scripts on the
      <a href="https://phonograph.figureandsound.com/">Phonograph app</a>. Iâ€™ll
      be adding new ones regularly as I expand my own
      <span class="nowrap">repertoire. ðŸ”¤</span></p>
