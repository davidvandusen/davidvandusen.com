    <p>A couple months before my first trip to Japan, I built a little flash card app to help me learn katakana, the script used in Japan for loan words, among other things. The hope was, even if I couldn’t read most text (which would be written in other writing systems—hiragana and kanji,) I would be able to read some restaurant menus and signage.</p>
    <p>I’m a monolingual English speaker. My grade school curriculum included French language classes, but the language didn’t stick because there were few opportunities to practice it on the west coast of Canada. (The majority of French speakers in Canada are in Quebec, on the east coast, thousands of kilometers away.)</p>
    <p>What I’m trying to say is, I never had to <em>use</em> a writing system beyond the roman characters that can be input directly with the keys on a qwerty keyboard. I knew awkward ways to add accents to letters in the rare cases when I needed them.* But, even though I would see writing in other scripts because of the Chinese and Punjabi populations where I lived, I didn’t have anything compelling me to learn how to read them.</p>

    <p>In software development, there’s a commonly touted adage: “You are not your user.” It means that, as someone designing software, you need to keep in mind that the person using your software won’t have the same knowledge and experiences as you do, and acknowledging that will improve how well the software can be designed to meet the needs of its users. It can reference facts about the users of a software system, like geographical location, or their habits when working with a computer. For example, not all users of a software system will have a “State/Province” in their address, nor will they instinctively think to press and hold a UI element to select it.</p>
    <p>When writing software, it is impossible to take into account all the factual and habitual differences between users. When we make incorrect assumptions, we rely on peers, systems, and users to correct us. And each time our mind is opened by an example that contradicts our previously held views, we learn to write more inclusive software.</p>
    <p>When I started to use katakana, I felt many of my assumptions being challenged. [TODO I can learn other scripts—didn’t think so before. Easier to learn more about culture. Easier to understand native Japanese speakers speaking in English. Have a new method of testing capabilities of software to handle IME composition.]</p>
    <p>I am also better prepared to learn other writing systems and the cultures that use them. Let me introduce you to the app I’ll be using to learn the characters from other writing systems.</p>
