      Know What You’re Selling</h1>

    <p>Some websites use <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tags to tell users what
      they’re missing out on when their browsers don’t run JavaScript (often
      because it’s disabled or they’re using an ad blocker).</p>
    <p>Some websites only make it halfway there. They go to the trouble of
      adding <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tags, but simply say, “This site uses
      JavaScript for stuff, so turn it on,” and make no effort to explain what
      the stuff is or why it’s valuable.</p>
    <p>As people who make websites, it’s our jobs to communicate to users what
      the site offers and why they should want it. This applies to everything
      from navigation link text to button labels.</p>
    <p>Consider the following <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> text from the wild
      and ask yourself how you would react as a user who has JavaScript disabled
      because of privacy, security, mobile bandwidth, or other concerns.</p>
    <figure>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“This site requires JavaScript to run correctly. Please turn on
          JavaScript or unblock scripts.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <figcaption>I didn’t come here to “run” the website, I came to read some
        text, and that seems to be working just fine.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“Your browser’s Javascript functionality is turned off. Please turn
          it on so that you can experience the full capabilities of this
          site.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <figcaption>But I didn’t come to “experience capabilities”. I came to read
        text.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“Your browser does not support the NLM PubReader view. Go to
          <a href="#">this page</a> to see a list of supported browsers or
          return to the <a href="#">Article in classic view</a>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <figcaption>Thanks for the helpful links, but my browser <em>is</em> on
        that list. And I can’t “return” anywhere because this newfangled thing
        is the default—I came straight here.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“Hello! Javascript is required for purchasing, signing up for the
          newsletter, viewing videos, and other content on this page. Please
          enable Javascript.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <figcaption>Well done for mentioning specific features, but, since this
        message isn’t in proximity to the features mentioned, it sounds more
        like a plea to get the “other content” loaded, which is probably
        advertising.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by
          Disqus.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <figcaption>Shows up where I would expect the comments section to be,
        so +1 for proximity. Now I get to ask myself whether I want to read
        comments written by strangers on the internet.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“JavaScript seems to be disabled in your browser. For the best
          experience on our site, be sure to turn on Javascript in your
          browser.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <figcaption>So far my experience has been alright! I’ll keep the option in
        mind, though.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“Please enable Javascript and refresh the page to continue.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <figcaption>Oops! I just hit the back button instead of the refresh
        button. 😈</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“JavaScript is required for full functionality of this site.
          <a href="#">Learn how to enable JavaScript in your web
          browser</a>”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <figcaption>Which functionality, though? Maybe it’s not the functionality
        I want to use.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“Activate JavaScript! Please activate JavaScript in your browser and
          refresh this page. This platform will only perform optimally once
          JavaScript is activated.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <figcaption>I’m OK with suboptimal. 😀 Don’t worry, I won’t
        hold it against you.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“Please turn JavaScript on and reload the page. DDoS protection by
          Cloudflare”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <figcaption>Isn’t every web page on the internet being DDoSed at all
        times? It’s just that the volume of the attack is too low and
        uncoordinated to cause a degradation of service.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“This website requires JavaScript enabled to checkout.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <figcaption>I mean, I’m checkin’ out your site right now. Oh, you mean,
        like, to give you money.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“You have JavaScript disabled. For the best experience, please turn
          JavaScript on. <a href="#">Here's how</a>”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <figcaption>Experience is subjective. How do you know that turning
        JavaScript on won’t make my experience worse?</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“JavaScript is disabled in your browser. In order to use the IKEA
          Search, JavaScript needs to be enabled.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <figcaption>I wonder why. To be honest, a list of product names that I
        could <kbd>cmd+f</kbd> through would probably be faster.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“JavaScript is required for parts of this site, like downloading
          elementary OS and some interactive components.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <figcaption>Noted.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“This website is literally about JavaScript. I mean what did you
          expect, a .NET application? This website is 99.9% poorly optimized and
          highly questionable JS. And yet, you have JS turned off.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <figcaption>Fair enough! Can’t argue with that.</figcaption>
