    <p>I learned to use English among academic, artsy, native speakers. Our
      lexicon was erudite. [The words we used showed off how well-read we were.]
      However, using rare, metaphorical, hyperbolic, and euphemistic words just
      doesn’t work for me anymore.</p>
    <p>Instead of trying to impress my friends with my vocabulary, I’m trying
      out another way of choosing words. Nowadays, I use English with casual,
      genuine, non-native speakers. Our goal is to communicate, especially at
      work. However, there are a lot of metaphors and euphemisms that are common
      among technologists, and that makes that harder.</p>
    <p>I’m trying to use fewer metaphors to be better understood. One risk of
      choosing not to use common metaphors is that I might have to use more
      words, and my listener might wonder why I’m not using the common
      expression. Since I’ve started practicing, that hasn’t been a problem.
      There’s always a better thing to say.</p>
    <p>Here are some examples of changes I’m making. Some words
      are offensive, some don’t convey any additional information, and some are
      just incorrect.</p>
    <h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
    <p>When I used to talk with people about “Quality Assurance”, I’m not sure
      any of us knew what we were actually talking about. We didn’t know how
      quality was being measured, nor how we were <em>assuring</em> it. If we
      were being honest, we could have said, “Trying it out in staging.”</p>
    <p>Now I’m more likely to talk about “looking for edge cases”, or “trying to
      break it”. I don’t think a formal sounding word like “Quality Assurance”
      or even something more correct like “defect detection” helps in the
      day-to-day situations when technologists talk about this process.</p>
    <h2>Sanity check</h2>
    <p>When I used to say “sanity check”, I was talking about checking
      something, but it never had anything to do with psychology. Without adding
      confusion or more words, I’ve said “consistency check”, or even just
      “check” and been fully understood.</p>
    <h2>Nuke</h2>
    <p>The imagery of “nuking” some code that has been problematic is exciting,
      and horrific. If I want to communicate that something will be completely
      removed, now I’ll say “complete remove” instead of invoking the horrors of
      war.</p>

    <p>I’ll continue to document phrases and alternatives here as I try them
      out. 💬</p>
