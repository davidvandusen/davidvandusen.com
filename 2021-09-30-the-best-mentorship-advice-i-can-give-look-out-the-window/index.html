    <p>As a mentor, itâ€™s common to ask a mentee prompting questions that they
      have the knowledge to answer. Mentors ask these questions to reinforce
      trains of thought that they have found valuable in their own work. They
      have identified that the mentee is in a common situation, and want to show
      them a path that leads to a solution.</p>
    <p>Because the mentor has followed this path numerous times, their access to
      the answer is quick. The mentee has the required knowledge, but they may
      not have applied it in their current situation before. Therefore, it may
      take some time for them to determine which knowledge the mentor is
      seeking. They also need time to construct an appropriate answer from their
      knowledge using an unfamiliar vernacular.</p>
    <p>This situation causes push and pull between the mentor and mentee, as
      well as internal conflict. Each wants to resolve the problem efficiently,
      but understand that the outcome of the interaction should also include
      learning. The mentee might be frustrated that they are being asked
      prompting questions when they just want to know the solution to their
      problem. The mentor may feel conflicted because the mentee is taking a
      long time thinking about an answer to the question, and they could break
      the silence and give them the answer to get the conversation moving
      again.</p>
    <p>This is where to apply the advice. Whatâ€™s happening in the menteeâ€™s brain
      while they try to answer the question is one of the critical moments of
      learning: strengthening neural pathways between their understanding of a
      situation and knowledge that they can apply to the situation. It is
      crucial to not interrupt this process! It can take minutes of active
      thought to answer some prompting questions. My advice to mentors is to let
      it happen all the way to the end. The flood of neurotransmitters that they
      produce upon traversing their knowledge to conclusion, and from the
      mentorâ€™s ultimate approbation, is the process that reinforces that pathway
      in their brain.</p>
    <p>When I have given this advice to aspiring mentors, they have often
      retorted that theyâ€™re not patient, and that makes it difficult to wait for
      their mentee to finish processing the question. In my experience, lack of
      patience is easy to address. While a mentee is deep in thought trying to
      answer a mentorâ€™s question, they tend not to make eye contact with the
      mentor. They may look at their work, or off into the distance. This is the
      mentorâ€™s opportunity to do the same. If the mentor looks away from the
      mentee while theyâ€™re thinking, it reduces the social pressure on them to
      shortcut their thinking and gives them the freedom to fully explore their
      knowledge to find the answer.</p>
    <p>Look distracted! If the mentee is self-conscious about how long theyâ€™re
      taking to answer, the best thing the mentor can do is to hide any outward
      signs that theyâ€™re waiting. No foot tapping, no watch checking. This is
      where the cure to impatience comes in: donâ€™t just <em>look</em> lost in
      thoughtâ€”feel free to actually zone out, look out the window (or away from
      the camera if youâ€™re on a video callâ€š) and think about something else. In
      the thousands of encounters when Iâ€™ve done this, I never received feedback
      that I seemed unengaged. Quite the opposite: mentees commonly thanked me
      for waiting so patiently for them.</p>
    <p>As a mentor yourself, think about the last time you were asked a
      prompting question. Were you interrupted before you could fully think
      through your answer? Were you allowed to think through your response
      thoroughly? If you were given time to think it through, how did you feel
      about the way that the asker was waiting for you? Were they making eye
      contact with you the whole time, occasionally glancing at their watch? Did
      they look like they had dropped out of the conversation and had to be
      reminded that you were there, ready to provide your answer? What kind of
      experience do you want to provide for your own mentees? ðŸªŸðŸ‘€</p>
