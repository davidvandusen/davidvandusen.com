    <p>In their first week with <a href="https://commit.dev/">Commit</a>, each
      new Engineering Partner takes on a hackathon onboarding project. They
      build a project, present it to the Commit community, and write a short
      summary of their experience. There are no restrictions, no limits, no
      joke.</p>
    <p>I decided to spend my first week at Commit developing a sensibility for
      working with CRDTs (commutative/conflict-free replicated data types) in
      the context of a collaborative document editing application.</p>
    <h2>Why CRDTs</h2>
    <p>Around 2018/19, there was growing buzz about technologies that enable
      near real-time collaborative editing of documents in web apps without some
      drawbacks of other approaches (like Operational Transformation—does
      anybody remember <a
      href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/wave/whitepapers/operational-transform/operational-transform.html">Google
      Wave</a>?)</p>
    <p>I recall watching <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5NULPSiOGw">CRDTs and the Quest for
      Distributed Consistency</a>, reading <a
      href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/">How
      Figma’s multiplayer technology works</a>, and playing with <a
      href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19605052">Room.sh</a> at around
      the same time.</p>
    <h2>The experience of building with CRDTs</h2>
    <p>I test-drove a popular CRDT library for JavaScript called <a
      href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs">Yjs</a> by writing a simple app where
      users can modify a document whose data is represented as a tree. If the
      app is still online, it can be seen at <a
      href="https://hop.figureandsound.com/">hop.figureandsound.com</a>.</p>
    <p>After a couple snags and gotchas, I wrapped my head around the concepts
      pretty quickly. Here are my takeaways about working with Yjs.</p>
    <h3>There are limitations on the operations that can be performed</h3>
    <p>You can only do inserts and deletes. Moving a node is a delete plus an
      insert. Operations each get a unique ID (in the form of a <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp">Lamport
      Timestamp</a>), but nodes are not uniquely identifiable, so there aren’t
      operations for moving them around the data structure. If the data
      structure is a tree, a move operation will delete the whole subtree under
      the moving node and reinsert a clone of it at its new parent.</p>
    <h3>Think through the lifecycle of a document</h3>
    <p>Depending on how many users are likely to edit a document concurrently,
      whether they’ll be doing so offline and syncing later, and how deeply
      nested the data structure is likely to get, there may be risks of
      (perceived) data loss. Of course, since the CRDT preserves all operations,
      no data is truly lost, but without care taken in the design of the user
      experience, I can imagine scenarios that, if not handled carefully, would
      cause users to panic upon seeing their changes disappear during a
      sync.</p>
    <h3>Understand the options and the ecosystem</h3>
    <p>It’s great to see that there is ongoing research into these technologies.
      The algorithms and data structures are continually being optimized. New
      network and persistence plugins are being added to the Yjs project.
      Choosing any CRDT implementation means joining an active community of
      researchers who are working on making this technology more mainstream.</p>
    <h2>Another tool in my tool belt</h2>
    <p>I would encourage any web developer to give Yjs a spin. Reading <a
      href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310212186_Near_Real-Time_Peer-to-Peer_Shared_Editing_on_Extensible_Data_Types">the
      paper</a> and other supporting materials doesn’t take a big commitment,
      and making a simple app is all it takes to get a feel for how to use it. I
      look forward to getting a chance to apply the technology to a more
      ambitious project.</p>
